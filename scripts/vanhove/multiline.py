def multiline(xs, ys, c, ax=None, **kwargs):
    """Plot lines with different colorings

    Parameters
    ----------
    xs : iterable container of x coordinates
    ys : iterable container of y coordinates
    c : iterable container of numbers mapped to colormap
    ax (optional): Axes to plot on.
    kwargs (optional): passed to LineCollection

    Notes:
        len(xs) == len(ys) == len(c) is the number of line segments
        len(xs[i]) == len(ys[i]) is the number of points for each line (indexed by i)

    Returns
    -------
    lc : LineCollection instance.
